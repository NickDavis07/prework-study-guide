# Simple Note-Taking App

## Description
This project is a basic note-taking application designed to help capture and organize notes throughout a coding bootcamp. The main goal is to provide a simple and efficient way to add and view notes while working through the course content.

### Purpose
This project serves as a practical introduction to the basics of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, as well as the general development process. It allows for hands-on practice with front-end web technologies while building a functional and useful tool.

### What Problem Does It Solve?
It simplifies the process of capturing and organizing notes by providing a dedicated space for them. Instead of juggling multiple files or documents, users can focus on their learning while maintaining an organized system for their notes.
